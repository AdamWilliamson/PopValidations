	Param - Switch (seemingly done, as Custom, needs its own type, needs to feed cases fowards as and NOT's)
	Param Tests  (mostly done)
	Return Value Tests (mostly done)
	Generic Parameter Names fixed. (Fixed)
	Function Description style fixed. (Fixed)
	Scoping (partially tested, appears to work)

	..  Make Context a class instead of a Dictionary.
	.. Update Class names to match ApiAbstract.
	.. Update Namespace to include Pop   on ApiValidations
	.. Adding a Context item shold be listable, not just single items.
	Foreach seems untested.  Fix that.
